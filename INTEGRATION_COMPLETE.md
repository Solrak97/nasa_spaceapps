# üéâ RAG Integration Complete!

## What Was Done

Your audio pipeline now has **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** integrated! Your AI agent can now access a knowledge base and give factual, accurate answers.

## üì¶ What You Got

### 1. RAG-Enhanced Audio Pipeline ‚≠ê
- **File**: `app/custom_pluggins/genai_audio_pipeline.gd` (UPDATED)
- **What**: Your audio pipeline now automatically retrieves context from a knowledge base
- **How**: Just call `enable_rag()` and it works!

### 2. TF-IDF RAG Microservice
- **Files**: `microservices/simple_rag/`
  - `app.py` - The RAG service
  - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
  - `README.md` - Full documentation
- **What**: Lightweight semantic search using TF-IDF (no heavy ML models!)
- **Why**: Better than keywords, easier than Elasticsearch

### 3. RAG Client for Godot
- **File**: `app/custom_pluggins/rag_client.gd`
- **What**: Connects Godot to the RAG microservice
- **Used by**: The audio pipeline automatically

### 4. Complete Examples
- **File**: `app/agent_audio_pipeline_with_rag.gd`
- **What**: Full working example with custom data
- **Shows**: How to add knowledge, test retrieval, use in VR

### 5. Documentation
- **`RAG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** ‚Üê **START HERE!** Quick copy-paste guide
- **`app/custom_pluggins/RAG_AUDIO_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md`** ‚Üê Complete guide
- **`microservices/simple_rag/README.md`** ‚Üê Service documentation
- **`RETRIEVAL_OPTIONS.md`** ‚Üê Decision guide (keyword vs TF-IDF vs Elasticsearch)
- **`app/custom_pluggins/RETRIEVAL_COMPARISON.md`** ‚Üê Detailed comparison

## üöÄ How to Use It (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start RAG Service (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd microservices/simple_rag
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Takes 2 minutes
python app.py                    # Service runs on :8001
```

Keep this running! ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Enable in Your Code

```gdscript
func _ready():
    # Configure (same as before)
    GenaiAudioPipeline.configure_llm("http://localhost:11434", "", "llama3.2")
    GenaiAudioPipeline.configure_tts("http://0.0.0.0:8000", "en-GB-RyanNeural")
    
    # NEW: Enable RAG!
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.enable_rag()
    
    # Set personality
    GenaiAudioPipeline.set_system_prompt("""
    You are Mariana, an ocean VR guide.
    Use the knowledge base to provide accurate information.
    Keep answers short and engaging.
    """)
```

### Step 3: Add Your Custom Data

```gdscript
# Add facts about YOUR museum/domain!
await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag(
    "mariana trench depth exploration",  # Topic with keywords
    """
    The Mariana Trench is 11,000 meters deep.
    James Cameron reached the bottom in 2012.
    Only three people have ever been there.
    """
)

await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag(
    "bioluminescence deep sea creatures",
    """
    90% of deep sea creatures produce their own light.
    Bioluminescence is used for hunting, mating, and defense.
    The light is created through chemical reactions.
    """
)

# Add as many as you need!
```

### Step 4: Use It (No Changes!)

```gdscript
# Chat normally - RAG works automatically!
await GenaiAudioPipeline.chat_and_play(
    "How deep is the Mariana Trench?",
    $AudioPlayer
)

# The agent will:
# 1. Find relevant facts from knowledge base
# 2. Use them to answer accurately
# 3. Speak the response in VR
```

**That's it!** Your agent is now RAG-powered! üéâ

## üìö How to Add Custom Data - Quick Reference

### Method 1: At Startup (Simple)
```gdscript
func _ready():
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.enable_rag()
    
    # Add all your facts
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag("topic 1", "content 1")
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag("topic 2", "content 2")
    # etc.
```

### Method 2: From JSON File (Organized)

Create `res://ocean_facts.json`:
```json
{
    "mariana trench depth": "The Mariana Trench reaches 11,000 meters...",
    "ocean temperature": "Ocean temps have risen 0.6¬∞C since 1900...",
    "coral reefs": "Coral reefs support 25% of marine species..."
}
```

Load it:
```gdscript
func load_knowledge():
    var file = FileAccess.open("res://ocean_facts.json", FileAccess.READ)
    if file:
        var data = JSON.parse_string(file.get_as_text())
        file.close()
        
        for topic in data.keys():
            await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag(topic, data[topic])
```

### Method 3: Dynamically (Context-Aware)
```gdscript
# When user enters a new area
func on_zone_changed(zone_name: String):
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag(
        "current location zone",
        "Visitor is in the %s zone, featuring..." % zone_name
    )

# When user views an exhibit
func on_exhibit_interaction(exhibit: String, info: String):
    await GenaiAudioPipeline.add_knowledge_to_rag(
        exhibit + " exhibit interaction",
        info
    )
```

### Method 4: Edit Service Directly (Permanent)

Edit `microservices/simple_rag/app.py`:

```python
knowledge_base = [
    {
        "topic": "Your Topic",
        "content": "Your information..."
    },
    # Add more...
]
```

Restart service: `python app.py`

---

## üéØ What Makes Good Knowledge?

### ‚úÖ Good Topic Names (Keywords!)
```
"deep sea submersibles vehicles depth"
"ocean temperature warming climate change"
"bioluminescence creatures light adaptation"
```

### ‚ùå Bad Topic Names
```
"info1"
"facts"
"stuff"
```

### ‚úÖ Good Content (Focused!)
```
2-5 sentences
Clear facts
Specific numbers
Relevant details
```

### ‚ùå Bad Content
```
Long rambling paragraphs
Vague information
Off-topic details
```

        They support unique ecosystems based on chemosynthesis, not sunlight.
        Tube worms, giant clams, and specialized bacteria thrive there.
        Water temperatures can reach 750¬∞F (400¬∞C) at the vents.

## üîç Testing Your Knowledge

```gdscript
# Test what RAG finds
await GenaiAudioPipeline.test_rag_retrieval("deep ocean")
await GenaiAudioPipeline.test_rag_retrieval("bioluminescence")

# See all knowledge
var kb = await GenaiAudioPipeline.get_all_rag_knowledge()
print("Knowledge base has %d entries" % kb["count"])
for entry in kb["entries"]:
    print("  - ", entry["topic"])
```

## üìä What Happens Now

### Before (Without RAG):
```
User: "How deep is the Mariana Trench?"
  ‚Üì
LLM: Generates answer from training data (may be wrong/vague)
  ‚Üì
Speaks: "The Mariana Trench is very deep..."
```

### After (With RAG):
```
User: "How deep is the Mariana Trench?"
  ‚Üì
RAG: Searches knowledge base
     ‚Üí Finds: "The Mariana Trench is 11,000 meters deep..."
  ‚Üì
LLM: Gets question + accurate facts
     ‚Üí Generates informed answer
  ‚Üì
Speaks: "The Mariana Trench reaches 11,000 meters deep, 
         making it the deepest point on Earth!"
```

**Accurate, factual answers every time!** ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Key Benefits

| Feature | Before | After (RAG) |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Variable | High (uses your facts) |
| **Custom knowledge** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Can add any data |
| **Context-aware** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Knows exhibit locations |
| **Updatable** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Add facts at runtime |
| **Domain-specific** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Your museum data |

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "RAG service not available"
```bash
# Start the service:
cd microservices/simple_rag
python app.py

# Check it's running:
curl http://localhost:8001/
```

### "No context retrieved"
- Add more keywords to topic names
- Test: `await GenaiAudioPipeline.test_rag_retrieval("your query")`
- Add more knowledge entries

### "Wrong context returned"
- Improve topic keywords
- Make content more specific
- Check: `await GenaiAudioPipeline.get_all_rag_knowledge()`
